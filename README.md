# Task 6: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification

## 📌 Objective
Implement and understand the KNN algorithm using the Iris dataset.

## 💡 What I Learned
- How KNN works (instance-based learning)
- Importance of feature scaling
- Role of distance metrics in classification
- How to tune `K` and evaluate models

## 📊 Dataset Used
**Iris Dataset** – Contains 150 samples across 3 flower species.

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## 📁 Files
- `knn_classifier.py`: Full implementation and visualization
- `Iris.csv`: Dataset used

## 📉 Results
Model accuracy: ~97%  
Confusion matrix and classification report printed in console.
